# Overview of Repo
This repository is your guide to successfully completing RTL (Register-Transfer Level) and GLS (Gate-Level Simulation) for a Interrupt Controller design model. This project will help you gain hands-on experience with digital logic design and simulation.


# Interrupt Controller

The primary purpose of an interrupt controller is to handle interrupt requests and determine which interrupt to service next based on their priority levels.



## RTL Simulation

It is an essential step in the process of designing and verifying digital hardware components, such as microprocessors, ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays).
We use Gtkwave to view the output.

## RTL Synthesis
RTL synthesis optimizes the design for area, speed, and power consumption.
RTL synthesis performs timing analysis to ensure that the design meets its required performance criteria.

## GLS Synthesis

 This stage follows RTL synthesis and involves converting the logical description of the design into a physical layout that can be manufactured.
